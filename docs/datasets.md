# Datasets
There are three datasets within the MillionAnimals package: AnimalBoxes, AnimalPoints, and AnimalPolygons. These datasets contain many source datasets from dozens of papers and research efforts. Below, each source is briefly described. The images for each dataset are generated directly from the dataloaders to allow rapid verification of the annotation status and are regenerated automatically when a new dataset is released or updated. Sample images within a dataset are *randomly selected* within to ensure transparency. This does mean that some images are sparsely annotated compared to the rest of the images in a source.

*Note: The datasets below are processed and will be part of the final release. The current release is pre-release and not final. Only publicly available datasets are included at this time.*

**Dataset Collection:** We are actively collecting datasets for inclusion. Please see our [dataset collection spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12D3BnlE1car_CzngrwoPG7uySKoaKweYkneEBkgrRKw/edit?usp=sharing) for datasets under consideration.

## AnimalBoxes

Bounding box annotations of animals from aerial imagery. These datasets provide rectangular bounding boxes around individual animals detected in drone, aircraft, or satellite imagery.
